					<p class="lead">The US accounts for 4% of the world's population.  The US is
					  responsible for <b>25%</b> of the world's prisoners.  Right now, that's 70
					  million people convicted of a crime, with an expected 100 million by 2030.  Of
					  those 70 million, 2.5 million are in prisons and jails and 4.5 million are on
					  probation or parole.  Where are the other 63 million?  They are part (19%) of
					  the 329.5 million people that live in the US.  The US unemployment rate is
					  currently under 4%.  But for people with conviction histories, itâ€™s 27%.  Gainful
					  employment (of the formerly incarcerted) is the #1 correlate to non-recidvism.
					  What's that mean exactly?  It means if you can make a thriving wage, it will
					  keep you from going back to jail.  How can people with records find work when
					  they are banned from so many industries by laws and regulations and when
					  illegal and inaccurate background checks routinely, summarily dismiss qualified
					  candidates that have already received offers?</p>
