		<p class="lead">The US accounts for 4% of the world's population.  The US is
			responsible for <b>25%</b> of the world's prisoners.  Right now, that's 70
			million people convicted of a crime, with an expected 100 million by 2030.  Of
			those 70 million, 2.5 million are in prisons and jails and 4.5 million are on
			probation or parole.  Where are the other 63 million?  They are part (19%) of
			the 329.5 million people that live in the US.  The US unemployment rate is
			currently under 4%.  But for people with conviction histories, itâ€™s 27%.  Gainful
			employment (of the formerly incarcerted) is the #1 correlate to non-recidvism.
			What's that mean exactly?  It means if you can make a thriving wage, it will
			keep you from going back to jail.  How can people with records find work when
			they are banned from so many industries by laws and regulations and when
			illegal and inaccurate background checks routinely, summarily dismiss qualified
			candidates that have already received offers?</p>
